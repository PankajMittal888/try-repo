    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page using a series of elements and tags. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p>
